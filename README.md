## PIZZA-licious

### Project Description
PIZZA-licious is a Java console application that lets users build and order custom pizzas.  
Customers select their pizza size, crust, toppings, cheese, and sauce, then add drinks and garlic knots before checking out.  
Once the order is complete, the app creates a timestamped receipt and saves it in a `receipts/` folder.

This project demonstrates advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles including abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
